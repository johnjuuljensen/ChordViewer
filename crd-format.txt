CRD Directives

General format:
{directive:parameters}

Supported directives:

start, begin
Desc: Starts a new named section. Sections cannot be nested. A named section must end with an 'end' directive. Named blocks can be redefined, so if the chorus changes, then it can be redefined and later repeats will use the new definition.
Ex: {start:chorus}

end
Desc: Ends a named section. The directive parameters are ignored.
Ex: {end:} 

reference, include, insert
Desc: inserts a copy of a named section.
Ex: {insert:chorus}

|, repeat
Desc: Marks the following section as to be repeated. The '|' directive key was chosen because in normal sheet music repeat is written as '|:', which fits nicely with the directive syntax. 
Ex: {|:x3} 


//, comment, note
Desc: Use for comments.
Ex: {//:Some comment}


CRD proposed directives
{title:}

{subtitle:}

{artist:}

{end}
No colon.
No further processing after this directive. Notes, comments etc. can be placed after this directive.

{start_of_chorus}{end_of_chorus}
These seem like weird non-generic directives, not very useful.

{start:}{end:}
Example: {start:chorus}{end:chorus}
Defines a named block. 
Nested blocks are not allowed.
End block need not include the name, but must include the colon.
Named blocks can be redefined, so if the chorus changes, then it can be redefined and later repeats will use the new definition.

{repeat:}
Example: {repeat:chorus}
Repeat the content from a previous start/end directive pair.
